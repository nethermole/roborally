//Tech debt & Bugfixes
- Deserializing board into elementEnums isn't scalable. Let's actually serialize/deserialize the board better. full json into objects, not keying off of elementenum. see conveyor elementEnums
- Unit test code coverage to 95%
    - Includes untangling anything to refactors
- Fix/revisit wall logic
- Introduce a real logging framework
- General refactoring to improve separation of concerns
- Move constants to configuration
- Implement checkpoint order checks, and related logic around ending the game
- Reduce excess logic around "isReadyToProcessTurn"

    //Tech debt
    - Stop old game, Start new game on start
    - Get number of players from client at game start
    - Move constants to configuration

    //Features
    - Stacking board tiles
        - Sculpt my own tiles? could be fun digital art project.
            - Check out VR 3d art?
        - Defined order in stacknedness towards player camera, for ease of viewing tile
