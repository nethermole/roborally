//Tech debt & Bugfixes
- Game to builder pattern
- Deserializing board into elementEnums isn't scalable. Let's actually serialize/deserialize the board better. full json into objects, not keying off of elementenum. see conveyor elementEnums
- Remove ProofOfConceptView
- Unit test code coverage to 95%
    - Includes untangling anything to refactors
- Fix/revisit wall logic
- Introduce a real logging framework
- Get rid of runtime exceptions and use checked exception
- Remove "gamestate" in Game.java, assuming no logic using it. If so, abstract it out.
- General refactoring to improve separation of concerns
- Move constants to configuration
- Implement checkpoint order checks, and related logic around ending the game
