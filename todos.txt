DONT COMMIT TILL THIS IS FIXED:
game doesnt work beyond turn 2. or at least unity wont visualize it

//Tech debt & Bugfixes
- Players can walk over pits, as long as their end-position is not a pit
- Deserializing board into elementEnums isn't scalable. Let's actually serialize/deserialize the board better. full json into objects, not keying off of elementenum. see conveyor elementEnums
- Unit test code coverage to 95%
    - Includes untangling anything to refactors
- Fix/revisit wall logic
- General refactoring to improve separation of concerns
- Move constants to configuration
- Implement checkpoint order checks, and related logic around ending the game
- Reduce excess logic around "isReadyToProcessTurn"
- Separate getting game start into from GetViewUpdateList
- Wrap "getLogger" in a class, in case I choose to switch frameworks later
- Verify that client is getting their specific hand, otherwise its like looking at other players hands
